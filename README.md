# SSH Tunnel MenuBar APP for OS X

## Introduction

Since I was missing a tool that manages my SSH tunnels in a nice and clean way, I started one my own!

## Concept 

The main idea is to parse existing configs (like ~/.ssh/config) and create a list of possible nodes. These should later be annotated with a config file to keep their local SOCKS port.
